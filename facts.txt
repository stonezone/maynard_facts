Toolism: Before forming Tool, Maynard served as a forward observer in the U.S. Army, joining after high school to use the G.I. Bill for art school.
Meow‑sical Journey: While studying at Kendall College of Art and Design and working as an interior designer in Los Angeles, he began writing an early version of Tool’s first hit “Sober.”
Backstage Cat: On stage, Maynard likes to stand on a platform at the back facing away from the crowd so he can retreat into his own feline‑like headspace and take cues from his bandmates.
Fibonacci Feline: The syllable pattern in Tool’s song “Lateralus” follows the Fibonacci sequence—because Maynard loves mixing math with melody.

Black Belt Kitty: A longtime Brazilian jiu‑jitsu practitioner, Maynard earned his black belt on January 6, 2024—celebrated by posing his new belt next to a bottle of his own wine.
Stage Takedown: During a concert, a fan jumped on stage and Maynard calmly applied a jiu‑jitsu move to subdue him—because self‑control matters.
